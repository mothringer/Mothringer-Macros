# Mothringer-Macros
A collection of the automation macros I use for the pf2e system in Foundry VTT. Some are from the core system and only in this repository so that I can import all of them to new worlds with a single import compendium action. Dying PC and Condition Setter require the TurnAlert and The Forge modules in addition to the presence in the world of the helper macros RecoveryCheck and StatusCheck respectively in order to function.

As well as the original Macros that the below are based on:
