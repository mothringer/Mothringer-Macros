# Mothringer-Macros
A collection of the automation macros I use for the pf2e system in Foundry VTT. Some are lightly customized versions of the core system's community macros.

Dying PC and Condition Setter require the TurnAlert and The Forge modules in addition to the presence in the world of the helper macros RecoveryCheck and StatusCheck respectively in order to function.

To install in your world as a module, paste https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mothringer/Mothringer-Macros/main/module.json into the manifest URL field in the module installer.

The Light and Vision macro assumes that perfect vision is installed for low-light vision. If you do not have that module, you should choose normal vision instead for characters with low light vision.
